          <h2>Taking Delivery</h2>
          <p>
            Taking delivery of your new Tesla is a quick and easy experience.
            With Tesla Tutorial videos available right on your touchscreen, you
            can learn about the features and functions of your Tesla from the
            driver’s seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            After placing your order, sign in to your Tesla Account to complete
            the required delivery tasks and prepare for delivery. The latest
            updates on delivery timing, VIN assignment and appointment details
            will be available in your Tesla Account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on location and eligibility, your Tesla will be available
            for pickup at a delivery center or will be delivered to your
            location. Please note that delivery dates may change based on many
            factors including logistics and completion of your pre-delivery
            tasks.

            their car delivered, and who live more than 220 miles from the
            nearest Tesla delivery location. These deliveries are performed by
            independent carriers for a fee, based on your final delivery
            location. For faster delivery, we recommend taking delivery at a
            Tesla delivery location.

            estimate, explore our existing inventory options.
