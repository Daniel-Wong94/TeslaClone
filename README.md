# TeslaClone

First attempt at cloning webpages with just HTML and CSS.

## What I've learned so far:

- CSS Scroll Snap
- Full Page Image Background
- Visible line breaks with ::before ::after
- Embedding Vimeo videos
- Back to top anchors with smooth scroll

## Features still need to be implemented:

- Animated down arrow on homepage
- Animations on page load
- Animated button focus
- Button disappearing on scroll
- Carousel for shop items

## To Do's:

- Clean up code
- Apply React
- Fix FOUC issue
